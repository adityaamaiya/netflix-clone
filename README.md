# Netflix Clone Landing Page

This project is a **mobile-friendly** clone of the Netflix landing page, built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It replicates the main elements of Netflix's homepage, including the hero section, informational sections, and a footer. No JavaScript is used, and the layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to mobile devices as well as desktop screens.
- **Hero Section**: Includes a call-to-action (CTA) to encourage users to sign up.
- **Informational Sections**: Display information about Netflix's features such as watching on TV, offline downloads, and more.
- **Image Carousels**: Displays video or image elements for visual engagement.
- **FAQ Section**: Contains frequently asked questions with expandable answers.
- **Footer**: Includes links to various Netflix resources and contact information.
- **Custom Buttons**: Styled buttons for navigation and form submission.
